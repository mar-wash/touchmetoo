Drawing artistic inspiration from conceptual metaphor theory, Touch Me, Too! extends beyond linguistic analysis into embodied experience. If Lakoff (1992) argues that metaphor structures thought, this project asks what it means that we so readily understand COMPUTERS as HUMANS, i.e. the metaphorical notion that machines have “memory,” “vision,” “voice,” “nerves,” “brains,” and “bodies.” Through a corpus analysis of English-language data, the project seeks to trace explicit mappings between human anatomy and computer architecture, identifying where body parts are projected onto hardware and software systems. 

In its physical form, Touch Me, Too! becomes a sensory environment in which visitors are invited to encounter the computer as something that can touch and be touched. The installation asks: What happens to our experience of technology when the linguistic boundary between humans and computers begins to blur? Visitors might press, stroke, or hold components that respond through vibration, heat, or sound, collapsing the emotional distance between user and interface.
